# GeoBin - Working with Bitmap Indexed Spatial Data in Go

GeoBin is a GoLang package that provides a simple and efficient way to work with spatial data sets (such as GeoJSON) using bitmap indexes.

## Key Features

- **Integration with Uber's H3Geo**: Utilizes [uber/h3geo](https://h3geo.org) for aggregation, intersection, contains, and joining operations with geometry (spatial attributes).
- **Geometry Data Structure**: Employs [github.com/paulmach/orb](https://github.com/paulmach/orb) for managing geometry data structures.
- **Bitmap Indexing**: Implements bitmap indexing using [github.com/roaring/roaring](https://github.com/roaring/roaring).

## Subpackages

- **bjoin**: Manages the data structure to store results of joining two bitmap indexed data sets.
- **h3b**: Bitmap index specifically for H3 cells.
- **h3f**: Functions for working with H3 cells in Go, extending the uber/h3 (v4) package ([https://github.com/uber/h3-go](https://github.com/uber/h3-go)).
- **orbf**: Offers functions and operations for geometries.

## Testing and Fixtures

For testing purposes, GeoBin uses data from OpenStreetMap ([https://openstreetmap.org](https://openstreetmap.org)) to ensure reliability and accuracy.
